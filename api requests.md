## Rate Limiting

These endpoints follow the same rate limiting as other API endpoints:
- **General endpoints**: 60 requests per minute
- **Prayer endpoints**: 30 requests per minute (to prevent spam)
- **Feedback endpoints**: 10 requests per minute

## Notes for Developers

1. **Salvation Decisions**: Store locally until successful submission to prevent data loss
2. **Prayer Schedule**: Cache current schedule and refresh based on time slots
3. **Deeper Prayer**: Implement participation validation to prevent duplicate entries
4. **Feedback**: Provide rich feedback forms with appropriate validation
5. **Categories**: Update prayer category selection UI with new options
6. **Audio Integration**: Handle audio URLs with appropriate streaming/download logic

## Security Considerations

1. **User ID Validation**: Always validate that user_id matches authenticated user
2. **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all text inputs, especially testimonial content
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits to prevent service disruption
4. **Data Privacy**: Handle personal information (phone, email) according to privacy policies
5. **Session Management**: Ensure proper session handling for counseling feedback
