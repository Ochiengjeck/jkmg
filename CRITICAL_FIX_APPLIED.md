# 🔧 CRITICAL APK CRASH FIX APPLIED

## ✅ **Issue Identified and Fixed**

**Problem**: App was crashing on testers' devices with:
```
ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "com.jkmg.app.MainActivity"
```

**Root Cause**: When we changed the package name from `com.example.jkmg` to `com.jkmg.app`, the MainActivity class was still in the old package location.

## 🛠️ **Fix Applied**

### 1. **Updated MainActivity Package**
- **File**: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/jkmg/app/MainActivity.kt`
- **Changed**: Package declaration from `com.example.jkmg` to `com.jkmg.app`
- **Directory**: Moved file to correct package structure

### 2. **Removed Old Package Directory** 
- **Deleted**: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/` 
- **Reason**: Prevents build conflicts

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Rebuild Your APK:**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter build apk --release
```

### **The Fix Ensures:**
- ✅ MainActivity class matches package name (`com.jkmg.app`)
- ✅ Android manifest can find the correct MainActivity
- ✅ App will launch properly on all devices
- ✅ No more ClassNotFoundException crashes

## 📱 **Verification**

After rebuilding, the new APK should:
1. **Install successfully** on tester devices
2. **Launch without crashing** 
3. **Show your app's main screen**

## 🔍 **What Was Wrong Before**

```
MANIFEST LOOKING FOR: com.jkmg.app.MainActivity
ACTUAL FILE LOCATION: com.example.jkmg.MainActivity
RESULT: ClassNotFoundException = CRASH 💥
```

## 🎯 **What's Fixed Now**

```
MANIFEST LOOKING FOR: com.jkmg.app.MainActivity  
ACTUAL FILE LOCATION: com.jkmg.app.MainActivity
RESULT: SUCCESS! App launches properly ✅
```

## 📝 **Important Notes**

- **This was the exact reason** your testers couldn't use the app
- **The fix is simple** but critical for proper APK distribution
- **Always test APKs** on devices other than your development phone
- **Package name changes** require updating all references

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

After rebuilding:
- [ ] Install APK on your device (should still work)
- [ ] Send new APK to testers 
- [ ] Verify app launches and doesn't crash
- [ ] Check all main features work

**The crash issue should now be completely resolved!** 🎉
